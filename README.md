# Web-Ui-Automation-Cypress

The Cypress folder contains all of the files and folders that I created to test the Orange HRM demo website.

1. To view the Cypress code for page objects, navigate to: Cypress → cypress → e2e → orange-hrm-demo → page-objects. You will find all the page object files there.

2. To access the Cypress code for test cases, go to: Cypress → cypress → e2e → orange-hrm-demo → test-case. You will find all the test case files in that directory.

3. I have also added a video of the test case execution. You can find it in the Cypress folder as well.
